BINARY DISTRIBUTION
-------------------
Simply copy the files from the subdirectories to the relevant subdirectories of your MtoA installation (or somewhere in
the appropriate paths):

For MtoA (in-place install)
- Libraries and MTD files found in the 'bin' directory go somewhere in your ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH or in 'shaders' under your MtoA installation directory
- *.py interface templates found in the 'ae' directory go somwhere in your MTOA_TEMPLATES_PATH or in 'scripts/mtoa/ui/ae' under your MtoA installation directory

For MtoA (custom install)
- Extract the package to an CryptomatteArnold folder somewhere on your filesystem.
- Set the ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH variable to include {CryptomatteArnold_INSTALL}/bin
- Set the MTOA_TEMPLATES_PATH variable to include {CryptomatteArnold_INSTALL}/ae
- Set the MAYA_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_PATH variable to include {CryptomatteArnold_INSTALL}/aexml

For C4DtoA
- Libraries and MTD files found in the 'bin' directory go somewhere in your ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH or in 'shaders' under your C4DtoA installation directory
- Copy content of C4DtoA directory to your C4DtoA installation directory

For SitoA
- Copy the content of the bin folder to  ...\Addons\SItoA\Application\Plugins\bin\nt-x86-64 in windows or ...\Addons\SItoA\Application\Plugins\bin\linux in linux
- That should be enough to at least get the shaders on the Arnold > DLL Shaders menu.
- Copy the SPDLs to ...\Addons\SItoA\Application\spdl
- In Softimage, before you try to use the shaders, generate presets (in the Plug-in Tree, right-click the spdl and click Regenerate Presets)
- In the render tree, you may need to refresh the preset manager to see the shaders.
- If you've already created some instances of the shader and they didn't have the PPGLayout, delete the spdl xsiindex in your $XSI_USERHOME\Application folder and start Softimage again.

For Katana
- Libraries and MTD files found in the 'bin' directory go somewhere in your ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH
- Copy the Args directory to the same place as you copy the binaries

For HtoA
- Copy the libraries and .mtd files in the 'bin' directory to HtoA/arnold/plugins or anywhere else in your ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH
